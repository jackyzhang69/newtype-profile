### 2.2 Qualifying Business Relationship

**Definition (IRCC Policy):**
> "Legal entities that have a parent, subsidiary, branch or affiliate business relationship. Both the Canadian and foreign companies must be, or will be doing business."

> "A company with no employees which exists in name only and is established for the sole purpose of facilitating the entry of intra-company transferees would not qualify."
