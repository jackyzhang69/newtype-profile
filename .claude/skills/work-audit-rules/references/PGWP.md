## 1. Definition & Eligibility

Post-Graduation Work Permit is a temporary work permit issued to international students who have graduated from a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) in Canada.

### 1.1 ALL Four Mandatory Criteria

ALL of the following must be satisfied - applicant fails if ANY criteria not met:

#### Criterion 1: Education Credential Requirement

**Eligible Programs** (from PGWP-eligible DLI):
- ✅ Bachelor's degree
- ✅ Master's degree
- ✅ Doctoral degree
- ✅ Other university programs (diploma, certificate)
- ✅ College programs (polytechnic)
- ✅ Non-university programs (if 8+ months)
- ✅ Flight school (+ Canadian pilot license or instructor rating + job offer)

**Program Duration Requirements**:
- Minimum: 8 months (minimum 24 weeks of actual instruction)
- Quebec exception: 900 hours minimum
- Cannot be entirely online (COVID-19 exceptions ended)

**Ineligible Programs** (AUTOMATIC REFUSAL):
- ❌ English/French language courses only
- ❌ General interest courses
- ❌ ESL/Language proficiency programs
- ❌ Non-degree programs from non-DLI schools
- ❌ Programs at non-Canadian institutions

- College/Polytechnic: CLB 5 (if app on/after Nov 1, 2024)
- Flight school: NO language requirement
- Exemption: NO requirement if study permit applied before Nov 1, 2024

#### Criterion 2: Study Status Requirement

- **Full-time student status**: Must maintain throughout each semester
- **Exception**: Part-time study acceptable in final semester only
- **Verification**: Through official student records from institution

**From Help Centre (qnum 513, 507)**:

| Requirement | Details | Risk Level |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| DLI Status | Must graduate from Designated Learning Institution | FATAL if not met |
| Program Length | Minimum 8 months | FATAL if < 8 months |
| Full-Time Study | Must maintain full-time status during all semesters | HIGH |
| Program Type | Academic, professional, or vocational training | HIGH |

#### Criterion 3: Application Timing Requirement (180-Day Window - CRITICAL)

**NOT 18 months - this is a common refusal cause**

**From Help Centre (qnum 755, 508)**:

| Deadline | Details | Consequence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 180 Days | From final marks issuance | FATAL - application refused |
| Study Permit Validity | Must be valid at some point during 180-day window | FATAL |
| Study Permit Expiry | Expires on permit date OR 90 days after completion (whichever first) | Status loss |

- **Deadline**: Apply within 180 days of program completion confirmation
- **Start Date**: When school confirms graduation (official date)
- **End Date**: 180 days later (approximately 6 months)
- **Grace Period**: Additional 90 days if study permit expires before 180 days (restore status + apply)
- **Absolute Rule**: Missing this deadline = automatic ineligibility
- **Port of Entry**: Cannot apply at ports of entry (as of June 21, 2024)

**Critical Rule**: Study permit must have been valid at some point during the 180-day application window.

#### Criterion 4: Study Permit Validity Requirement

- **Requirement**: Must have held valid study permit at some point during 180-day post-graduation window
- **Does Not Need**: Study permit to be held at time of PGWP application
- **Exception**: Can restore status if expired, then apply for PGWP

### 1.2 PGWP Validity Duration

**From Help Centre (qnum 509)**:

| Program Length | PGWP Duration |
|----------------|---------------|
| 8 months - < 2 years | Equal to program length |
| 2+ years | 3 years |
| Master's degree (< 2 years) | 3 years (special rule as of Feb 15, 2024) |
| Multiple programs | Combined length (if each eligible) |

**Passport Expiry Rule** (CRITICAL):
- Permit expires with passport, whichever comes first
- Can extend on paper after obtaining new passport

### 1.3 DLI Verification

**What is DLI?**
- Definition: School approved by provincial/territorial government to host international students

**Critical Point**:
- NOT all programs at a DLI are PGWP-eligible
- Must verify: (1) DLI status, (2) Program PGWP eligibility

**How to Verify**:
1. Visit: DLI list on canada.ca
2. Select province/territory
3. Search by institution name
4. Verify "Offers PGWP-eligible programs" = Yes
5. Cross-reference specific program eligibility

**2026 Update** (Effective Jan 1, 2026):
- Graduate degree students at public institutions: PALs/TALs NO LONGER required
- Still required: Letters of acceptance, standard documentation

### 1.4 One-Time Only Rule

**Ineligibility Factor**: Cannot get PGWP if already had one from earlier program
- Each graduate receives only one PGWP per lifetime
- Subsequent eligible programs: Cannot apply for second PGWP

### 1.5 Admissibility Requirements

- No grounds for inadmissibility
- Security and criminality clearance
- Medical examination if required
- No misrepresentation in application

- **Indicators**:
  - On-campus employment without authorization
  - Off-campus work during restricted periods
  - Self-employment during study
  - Employer-specific work permit overlap
  - Work exceeding authorized hours
- **Assessment Method**:
  - Study permit work authorization review
  - Employment timeline cross-reference
  - Employer verification
- **Recovery**: Explanation letter, employer confirmation

#### Pattern: PROGRAM_COMPLETION_FRAUD
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Definition**: Applicant did not actually complete program requirements
- **Indicators**:

- **Recovery**: None (requires in-status graduation)

### 2.2 Full-Time Study Requirement Violations (Case Law)

**Singh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 855**

**Facts:**
- Applicant studied at Langara College (May 2016 - August 2019)
- Program had scheduled break (September 2018 - December 2018)
- PGWP denied: "had not studied full time for at least eight months"

**Key Issues:**
- Scheduled breaks may not count toward full-time study
- Graduation letter must clearly explain any gaps
- Officer discretion on interpreting "continuous full-time"

**Risk Indicators:**
- Program with multiple breaks
- Part-time semesters (even one)
- Co-op/internship periods exceeding 50%
- Reduced course load without medical documentation

---

## 3. Common Refusal Patterns

### R205(1) - Refusal Decision Codes

1. **Not a designated learning institution**
   - Institution not DLI at time of application
   - Prior delisting occurred
   - Institution revoked status
   - Applicant studied at non-DLI

2. **Program duration insufficient**
   - Completed program < 8 months
   - Part-time did not meet full-time threshold
   - Insufficient course load
   - Credits below minimum

3. **Ineligible program type**
   - Language/ESL program only
   - Preparatory program not eligible
   - Continuing education without credential
   - Online-only without prior exemption

4. **Graduation not established**
   - Institutional records show non-completion
   - Diploma revoked or never issued
   - Academic standing insufficient
   - Conditions of graduation not met

5. **Application timing**
   - Submitted > 180 days post-graduation
   - Study permit expired before application
   - Continuity of status broken

6. **Program start date misalignment**
   - Post-secondary study began after international student status
   - Study permit issued after program commencement
   - No valid study permit overlap

---

## 4. Status Restoration Scenarios

### 4.1 Expired Study Permit

**From Help Centre (qnum 508)**:

If study permit expired before PGWP application:
1. Submit PGWP application within 90 days of losing status
2. Pay restoration fee ($350) separately online
3. Attach receipt to PGWP application
4. Continue meeting requirements for stay
5. Meet all remaining permit conditions

**Critical**: No separate restoration application needed - just pay fee and attach receipt.

### 4.2 PGWP Renewal Limitations

**From Help Centre (qnum 676)**:

> "Post-graduation work permits (PGWP) are a one-time opportunity for international students."

**Exception - Passport Expiry:**
- If PGWP was shortened due to passport expiry
- Can extend with new passport
- Include letter of explanation

**Alternative - Bridging Open Work Permit:**
- If waiting for PR decision under Express Entry
- Current work permit expires in 4 months or less
- Valid status on work permit
- Currently in Canada

---

## 5. Co-op and Internship Considerations

### 5.1 Co-op Work Permit Requirements

**From Help Centre (qnum 497)**:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Separate Work Permit | Required for co-op/internship |
| Proof Required | Letter from school OR curriculum copy |
| Work Limit | Cannot exceed 50% of total program |
| Ineligible | ESL/FSL students, general interest courses |

### 5.2 Impact on PGWP

**Risk Factors:**
- Co-op period may not count toward "study" time
- Must maintain full-time study status during academic terms
- Work experience portion scrutinized for PGWP eligibility

---

## 6. Off-Campus Work Rules

### 6.1 Current Rules

**From Help Centre (qnum 496)**:

| Condition | Hours Allowed |
|-----------|---------------|
| Class in session | Up to 24 hours/week |
| Scheduled breaks | Unlimited |

**Requirements:**
- Study permit must authorize off-campus work
- Must be enrolled full-time at DLI
- Academic, professional, or vocational program

### 6.2 Work Authorization on Study Permit

**Risk**: If study permit doesn't include off-campus work authorization:
- Cannot work off-campus
- Working without authorization = violation
- May affect PGWP eligibility

---

## 7. Document Checklist

## 9. Case Law References

### Key Federal Court Jurisprudence

**Genuine Program Completion (High Confidence)**
- Courts defer to institution graduation records
- Diploma is prima facie evidence of completion
- Institutional verification is determinative
- Fraud claims require compelling evidence

**DLI Status Verification (High Confidence)**
- Officer must verify institution was DLI at time of study
- Not current DLI status alone
- Historical database records are authoritative
- Burden on IRCC to demonstrate status loss

**Program Duration Calculation (High Confidence)**
- Days count: from first day of study to graduation
- Part-time study: officer must calculate equivalent full-time weeks
- Online study: pre-2023 exemption applied, post-2023 case-by-case
- Overlapping programs: only one program counts toward maximum

**Application Timing (High Confidence)**
- "Following graduation" interpreted as 180 days post-graduation
- Permissive interpretation for administrative delays
- But interpretation becomes strict for > 180 days
- Study permit expiry breaks timing chain

**Ineligibility Irreversibility (Medium Confidence)**
- Once deemed ineligible (e.g., ineligible program), may reapply
- But only if new eligible graduation obtained
- Cannot appeal ineligibility if facts accurate
- Officer discretion not engaged once objective criteria fail

### Risk Assessment Impact

**High Risk Thresholds**
- > 6 months post-graduation before application = document request likely
- Missing institutional confirmation letter = near-automatic delay
- Any DLI status ambiguity = verification delay (1-2 months typical)

**Medium Risk Thresholds**
- Program exactly 8-10 months duration = officer manual calculation required
- Part-time study period during DLI enrollment = requires breakdown
- Overseas completion of online final courses = assessment discretion engaged
