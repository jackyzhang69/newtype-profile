## 4. High-Risk Patterns from Case Law

### 4.1 Baniya v. Canada, 2022 FC 18 - Job Offer Misrepresentation

**Facts:**
- Iraqi citizen applied under BC PNP
- Job offer from Vision Glass LTD (construction supervisor)
- LMIA approved November 2016
- BC PNP nomination May 2017
- PR application January 2018

**Investigation Findings:**
- Vision Glass not operating from listed address since 2016
- Website inactive since 2016
- No social media presence
- Applicant had no contact with employer for years
- Did not apply for work permit despite stated need

**Outcome:**
- BC PNP cancelled nomination
- IRCC found misrepresentation under s.40 IRPA
- 5-year inadmissibility

**Key Lessons:**
1. Job offer must be **genuine at time of PR application**
2. Maintain contact with employer throughout process
3. Company must be actively operating
4. Consider applying for work permit to demonstrate intent

### 4.2 Asanova v. Canada, 2020 FC 1173 - Procedural Fairness

**Facts:**
- Russian citizen applied under PEI PNP and AIPP
- Employment reference letters questioned
- Procedural fairness letter sent but vague

**Key Issue:**
- PF letter stated "information does not appear to be genuine"
- Did not specify which aspects were concerning
- Applicant couldn't meaningfully respond

**Outcome:**
- Decision set aside for procedural fairness breach
- Matter remitted for reconsideration

**Key Lessons:**
1. Procedural fairness letters must be specific
2. Applicant must know the case to meet
3. Vague concerns = unfair process
