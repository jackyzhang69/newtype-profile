## 4. Relationship Genuineness Assessment

### 4.1 Cross-Reference with Spousal Sponsorship

**CRITICAL**: Open spouse work permit applications are assessed for relationship genuineness using similar criteria as spousal sponsorship.

**From Sharma v. Canada, 2009 FC 1131:**
- Marriage not genuine if entered primarily for immigration purposes
- Officer assesses totality of circumstances
- Timing of marriage relative to immigration status is relevant

### 4.2 Risk Factors (Aligned with Spousal App)

| Risk Factor | Indicator | Severity |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Timing | Marriage shortly before/after immigration issue | HIGH |
| Duration | Very short relationship before marriage | HIGH |
| Knowledge | Limited knowledge of each other | HIGH |
| Cohabitation | No evidence of living together | MEDIUM |
| Communication | Limited communication evidence | MEDIUM |
| Family | No family involvement/awareness | MEDIUM |

### 4.3 Evidence Requirements

**Same as Spousal Sponsorship:**
- Relationship timeline documentation
- Cohabitation evidence
- Communication records
- Photos (different times/places)
- Joint financial documents
- Third-party declarations

### 4.4 Shared Risk Patterns (from spousal-audit-rules)

The following risk patterns apply directly:
- `rushed_relationship` - Short courtship before marriage
- `lack_cohabitation_evidence` - No proof of living together
- `immigration_motive` - Timing suggests immigration purpose
- `testimony_contradiction` - Inconsistent statements
- `lack_mutual_knowledge` - Don't know basic facts about each other

### 4.5 Shared Evidence Standards

| Evidence Type | Weight | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Joint lease/mortgage | HIGH | A-level evidence |
| Joint bank accounts | HIGH | B-level evidence |
| Communication records | MEDIUM | C-level evidence |
| Photos | LOW | D-level evidence |
| Third-party letters | LOW | D-level evidence |

## 11. Case Law References

### Key Federal Court Jurisprudence

**Marriage of Convenience - Substantive Assessment (High Confidence)**
- Officer assesses genuineness of marriage
- Burden on applicant to prove genuine relationship
- Recent marriage and rapid visa application create suspicion
- Financial transaction between parties may indicate arrangement
- Courts defer to officer credibility assessment

**Principal Applicant Eligibility - Verification Mandatory (High Confidence)**
- Officer must verify principal applicant's work permit status
- Spouse application fails if principal ineligible
- NOC level requirement for spouse (must be A/B) strictly enforced
- Timing verification required (principal must have valid permit at spouse application time)

**Common-Law Recognition - Strict 12-Month Rule (High Confidence)**
- 12-month cohabitation requirement is mandatory
- Cannot be waived or reduced
- Must be continuous cohabitation
- Absence for employment reasons may be acceptable if family home maintained

**Refugee Status - Presumed Valid (High Confidence)**
- Once refugee status granted by IRB, presumed valid for work permit purposes
- Officer cannot second-guess IRB determination
- But work permit may still be refused on separate admissibility grounds
- Fraud or cessation of status changes analysis

**Admissibility - Always Required (High Confidence)**
- Even if relationship/status genuine, admissibility independently required
- Criminal background separately disqualifying
- Security concerns independently disqualifying
- Cannot be waived based on relationship

### Risk Assessment Impact

**High Risk Thresholds**
- Recent marriage (< 2 years) before visa application = enhanced documentation required
- No joint financial accounts despite years together = verification required
- Principal applicant work permit expires soon = status confirmation required
- Relationship established online = interview likely

**Medium Risk Thresholds**
- Principal applicant newly hired/recent employment = background verification
- Couple has limited joint assets = cohabitation documentation required
- Spouse not on principal's family information = clarification required
- Age gap > 15 years = enhanced scrutiny (not automatic refusal)

## 13. Integration with Spousal App Skills

### 13.1 When to Cross-Reference

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Open spouse + concurrent PR sponsorship | Use full spousal-audit-rules |
| Open spouse only (no PR) | Use relationship genuineness subset |
| Sponsored spouse OWP (C46) | Full spousal-audit-rules apply |

### 13.2 Skill Injection

For work permit audits involving spouse/partner:
- Inject `spousal-audit-rules/risk_patterns.json` (genuineness patterns only)
- Inject `spousal-doc-analysis/evidence_standards.md`
- Inject `spousal-doc-analysis/consistency_rules.md`

## 14. Key Takeaways

### 14.1 Fatal Issues

1. **Principal ineligible** - Wrong NOC, not full-time student, etc.
2. **Relationship not genuine** - Marriage of convenience finding
3. **Inadmissibility** - Criminal, security, health grounds
4. **Out of status** - No valid temporary resident status

### 14.2 High-Risk but Mitigable

1. **Short relationship** - Comprehensive evidence package
2. **Limited cohabitation** - Explanation + communication evidence
3. **Timing concerns** - Strong relationship history pre-dating immigration need
4. **Principal permit expiring** - Concurrent extension application

### 14.3 Best Practices

1. **Apply early** - Before principal's permit expires
2. **Document relationship thoroughly** - Same standards as spousal sponsorship
3. **Verify NOC classification** - Confirm TEER 0/1/2/3 eligibility
4. **Maintain status** - Both principal and spouse
5. **Consistent information** - All documents must align
6. **Address red flags proactively** - Explanation letters for any concerns
