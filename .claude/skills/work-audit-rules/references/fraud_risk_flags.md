# Fraud Risk Flags for Work Permits

## High-Risk Employer Indicators

### Employer Registration Issues
- **Newly registered** (< 6 months): Higher fraud risk
- **No verifiable address**: Vacant building or mail-drop only
- **Previous LMIA denials**: Employer has history of false applications
- **Multiple employer names**: Same principals operating under different entities
- **Shell company patterns**: Parent/subsidiary shell arrangements
- **No business activity**: Registration only, no actual operations

### LMIA Application Red Flags
- **Wages below sector norms**: Significant underpayment compared to industry
- **Rapid hiring**: Sudden need for multiple positions (classic fraud pattern)
- **Vague job descriptions**: Duties not clearly specified in LMIA
- **No recruitment documentation**: Failed to provide job postings, responses
- **Recruiting exclusively internationally**: No local recruitment attempt
- **Temporary/contract work**: Position not permanent despite LMIA claim

### Employment Verification Issues
- **Unreachable employer**: Phone/email unresponsive
- **Inconsistent contact information**: Different addresses in different documents
- **Non-operational worksite**: Address doesn't match business description
- **Third-party contractor**: Actual employer different from LMIA employer
- **Job outsourced elsewhere**: Position doesn't exist at claimed location

## High-Risk Applicant Indicators

### Credential Fraud
- **Unverifiable credentials**: University doesn't confirm degree
- **Diploma mills**: Credentials from non-accredited institution
- **Inflated qualifications**: Claims exceed documented education
- **Forged certificates**: Professional credentials are counterfeit
- **Language mismatch**: Credential from non-English institution, fluency claimed
- **Experience inflation**: Work history doesn't match credentials

### Settlement Intent Signals
- **Family in Canada**: Spouse/children already residing
- **Spouse visa application**: Concurrent family sponsorship application
- **Property purchase**: Recent real estate purchase in Canada
- **Lease term**: Apartment lease for 12+ months when permit is 1-2 years
- **Previous failed PR**: Multiple express entry/sponsorship applications denied
- **Canadian education path**: Recent student visa followed by work permit
- **No ties abroad**: No family, property, employment at origin

### Documentary Red Flags
- **Passport inconsistencies**: Multiple names, numerous stamps, gaps
- **Travel pattern**: Multiple short visits to Canada before work permit
- **Police certificate issues**: Missing, incomplete, or problematic
- **Medical exam delay**: Repeatedly postponed or incomplete
- **Supporting documents missing**: Gaps in requested documentation
- **Document quality**: Visible forgery, poor reproduction, inconsistencies

### Relationship Issues
- **Intimate relationship with Canadian**: Undisclosed spouse/partner in Canada
- **Marriage of convenience indicators**: Sudden marriage before application
- **Visa program hopping**: Study → temporary resident → work → PR pattern
- **Family unification**: All family members applying simultaneously
- **Beneficiary of sponsorship**: Recently sponsored relative now hiring applicant

## Employment Relationship Red Flags

### Suspicious Job Offer Characteristics
- **Temporary/casual contract**: No permanent position despite LMIA
- **Below-market wages**: Significantly undercompensated for position
- **Exploitative conditions**: Required housing deductions, excessive hours
- **Commission-based only**: No base salary, income unpredictable
- **Unusual terms**: Applicant pays for training, tools, certification
- **Restrictive clauses**: Non-compete, wage deductions, penalty clauses

### Workplace Reality Concerns
- **No worksite provided**: Remote work without employer office
- **Shared workspace only**: No dedicated employer facility
- **Contractor status**: Position would normally be employee, not contractor
- **Third-party payroll**: Paid by staffing agency, not actual employer
- **Task-based work**: No traditional employment relationship

## Immigration Program Abuse Patterns

### Work-to-PR Pipeline Fraud
- **Pathway coaching**: Applicant instructed to say specific things
- **Document packages**: Employer provides pre-written letters, fabricated credentials
- **"Consultation" fees**: Applicant pays recruitment/preparation fees
- **Credential services**: Shortcut credential verification schemes
- **Expression coaching**: Taught to respond as "genuine" rather than authentic

### Precarious Employment Abuse
- **Wage theft**: Promised wage not paid or illegally deducted
- **Excessive hours**: Work far exceeds contract terms

- **Harassment/discrimination**: Protected grounds violations
- **Isolation tactics**: Passport held, movement restricted
