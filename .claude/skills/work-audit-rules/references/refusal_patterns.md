## Detailed Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: LMIA Compliance Failure (28%)

**Why applications refused:**
- LMIA not obtained at all (applicant assumed LMIA-exempt when not eligible)
- LMIA shows negative assessment (Service Canada found Canadian workers available)
- LMIA expired between approval and work permit application
- LMIA issued for different employer or position
- Applicant lacks qualifications for LMIA-approved position

**Court reasoning:**
- Officer correctly applied R200 requirement for LMIA
- Discretion not unreasonable to require LMIA compliance
- Applicant bears burden of demonstrating LMIA or exemption

**High-risk indicators:**
- Job offer without LMIA documentation
- Extended time between LMIA and application (validity concerns)
- Employer name differs between LMIA and application
- Position title changed between LMIA and application

### Pattern 2: Employer Fraud Risk (18%)

**Why applications refused:**
- Employer investigation reveals fraud history
- Job offer appears fabricated (no actual position)
- Employer contact information unverifiable
- Employment letter inconsistent with employer records
- "Straw employer" arrangements detected

**Court reasoning:**
- Officer must assess genuineness of job offer
- Employer legitimacy is material to decision
- Misrepresentation by employer defeats application

**High-risk indicators:**
- Employer registration only weeks before application
- No verifiable business operations
- Previous LMIA fraud by same employer
- Job offer differs significantly from LMIA details

### Pattern 3: Credential Insufficiency (14%)

**Why applications refused:**
- Applicant qualifications below position requirements
- Education credentials unverified or false
- Work experience doesn't match claimed background
- Language barriers despite language-sensitive role
- Professional certifications missing or invalid

**Court reasoning:**
- Officer reasonably assessed capability to perform duties
- Credentials must objectively match position requirements
- Unverified credentials cannot be relied upon

**High-risk indicators:**
- Education from non-accredited institutions
- Work experience gaps or vague references
- No supporting credential verification documents
- Education/experience contradicts job requirements

### Pattern 4: Immigrant Intent (12%)

**Why applications refused:**
- Evidence indicates intent to settle permanently
- Spouse/children already in Canada
- Previous failed PR applications
- No ties to home country
- Pattern of work permit renewals suggesting settlement

**Court reasoning:**
- Applicant must demonstrate temporary intent
- Concurrent family ties in Canada evidence of intent to stay
- Officer reasonably inferred intent from evidence

**High-risk indicators:**
- Family members in Canada
- Recent property purchases in Canada
- No employment/family ties at origin
- Multiple previous work permits
- Settlement plan documentation

### Pattern 5: Admissibility Concerns (10%)

**Why applications refused:**
- Criminal record without waiver
- Security concerns
- Medical examination required but not completed
- Police certificate missing or problematic

- Medical exam incomplete
- Police certificate required but missing

### Pattern 6: Wage Compliance Issues (7%)

**Why applications refused:**
- Offered wages below provincial minimum
- Wages below LMIA prevailing rate

- Position title changed
- Skill level doesn't match NOC code
- Actual work differs from described position

**Court reasoning:**
- LMIA assessment specific to described position
- Applicant must perform duties as described in LMIA
- Deviation undermines LMIA authorization

**High-risk indicators:**
- Position title changed after LMIA approval
- Job description vaguer than LMIA
- Duties significantly differ from requirements

### Pattern 8: Insufficient Ties (3%)

**Why applications refused:**
- No immediate family abroad
- Minimal property/assets at home
- No employment history at origin
- Young applicant without responsibilities
- Multiple previous visa rejections

**Court reasoning:**
- Officer assessed ties to home country as weak
- Lack of incentive to return after permit expires

**High-risk indicators:**

- Young age without dependents
- Failed previous visa applications

## Federal Court Themes

### Discretionary Refusal Categories

**Genuine Position Test**
- Is the job offer authentic?
- Would applicant actually be employed as described?
- Is position required by employer?

Courts have found positions not genuine when:
- Employer has no actual business need
- Position created solely for immigration purposes
- Applicant has no real duties despite offer

**Employer Legitimacy**
- Is employer a legitimate business entity?
- Has employer complied with LMIA requirements?
- Is employer using immigration system fraudulently?

Courts have questioned legitimacy when:
- Employer operates as shell company
- Previous LMIA or work permit fraud
- Business registration recent with no track record

**Capability Assessment**
- Can applicant perform required duties?
- Do credentials match position requirements?
- Would officer's refusal be unreasonable?

Courts have upheld refusals when:
- Credentials clearly insufficient
- Experience doesn't match job level
- Assessment conducted fairly

**Intent Determination**
- Will applicant actually leave Canada?
- Are there indications of permanent settlement intent?
- Would officer's inference be reasonable?

Courts have upheld refusals when:
- Obvious immigrant intent signals present
- Family ties make return unlikely
- Pattern of application behavior indicates settlement
