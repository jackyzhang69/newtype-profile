2. No qualifying business relationship established
3. Failed to disclose 2002 TRV refusal

5. Company spending first year trying to penetrate new market

**Key Lessons:**
- Business plan must be realistic and supported

## 13. Case Law References

### Key Federal Court Jurisprudence

**Corporate Relationship - Objective Verification Required (High Confidence)**
- Applicant must prove same corporate group relationship
- Ownership documentation required; not presumed
- Parent-subsidiary and affiliate relationships clearly defined
- Officer may request corporate records from both entities
- Fraud in corporate structure is refusal ground

**12-Month Continuous Employment - Strict Requirement (High Confidence)**
- Minimum 12 months is mandatory, not discretionary
- Continuous employment requirement strictly enforced
- Breaks > 3 months exceed tolerance
- Employment must be with same corporate group entity
- Applicant cannot waive requirement

**Managerial/Specialized Knowledge - Substantive Assessment (High Confidence)**
- Officer assesses whether position meets criteria
- Burden on applicant to document and substantiate
- Generalist positions not covered
- Specialization must be exclusive to employer, not industry-wide
- Comparable international position demonstrates capability

**Temporary Assignment - Intent Assessment (Medium Confidence)**
- Officer assesses whether assignment is genuinely temporary
- Termination of international employment may indicate permanent intent
- Family establishment in Canada is relevant factor
- No return plan is risk indicator
- But officer cannot impose unreasonable duration limit

**Economic Benefit Assessment (Medium Confidence)**
- ICT is exemption; benefit to Canada not formally required
- But officer may consider whether position creates Canadian employment
- Knowledge transfer benefit relevant to discretionary assessment
- Not same stringent requirement as "Significant Benefits" category

### Risk Assessment Impact

**High Risk Thresholds**
- Any corporate relationship documentation missing = document request mandatory
- Any employment gap > 3 months = verification required
- International position details inconsistent = clarification required
- No return plan articulated = intent assessment triggered

**Medium Risk Thresholds**
- Position description ambiguous = detailed job duties required
- Specialized knowledge claim unclear = substantiation required
- Canadian entity < 1 year old = legitimacy verification required
- International office not responsive = employment verification letter required
