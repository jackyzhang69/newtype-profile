**Repeat for each significant incident.**

### Part 4: Seeking Protection (1-2 paragraphs)

Did you seek help?
- What you did (reported to police, sought legal help, etc.)
- Their response

OR if you didn't seek help:

## Writing Tips

### Be Specific

**DON'T write**:
> "They threatened me many times over the years."

**DO write**:
> "On March 5, 2024, two men from [group] came to my workplace. One of them, who I recognized as [name/description], said 'If you continue your activities, we will kill you and your family.' The second man showed me a knife."

### Use First Person

**DON'T write**:
> "The applicant was attacked..."

**DO write**:
> "I was attacked..."

### Include Feelings

**DON'T write**:
> "They threatened me."

**DO write**:
> "When they threatened me, I was terrified. I couldn't sleep for weeks. I was afraid they would come to my home."

### Explain Gaps

If there's something unusual, explain it:
- Long gap between events: "For the next year, I tried to live quietly, avoiding attention..."
- Delay in leaving: "I didn't leave immediately because I hoped the situation would improve..."
- Delay in claiming: "I didn't know I could claim refugee protection until..."

### Connect to Convention Ground

Make clear WHY you were targeted:

**DON'T write**:
> "They attacked me."

**DO write**:
> "They attacked me because I am [religion/political party member/etc.]. They said 'You [religious group/political supporters] don't belong here.'"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague**: Include specific details
2. **Skipping incidents**: Include all significant events
3. **Exaggerating**: Stick to what actually happened
4. **Contradicting documents**: Match your evidence
5. **Forgetting dates**: Use approximate dates if uncertain
6. **Not explaining**: If something is unusual, explain it
7. **Missing nexus**: Always show WHY you were targeted
