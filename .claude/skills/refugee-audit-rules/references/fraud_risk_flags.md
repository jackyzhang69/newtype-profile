# Refugee Fraud Risk Flags

## Overview

Fraud indicators specific to refugee protection claims. These flags do NOT determine outcome but trigger closer scrutiny.

## Identity Fraud Indicators

### Document Fraud
- **Multiple identities**: Use of different names, dates of birth across documents
- **Altered documents**: Evidence of tampering with travel documents
- **Fraudulent passports**: Obtained through corruption or criminal networks
- **Inconsistent biometrics**: Fingerprints don't match prior immigration records

### Identity Concealment
- **Destroyed documents**: Claimed destruction of all identity documents
- **Delayed disclosure**: Documents appear after initial claim of having none
- **Nationality shopping**: Evidence of claiming different nationalities
- **Age manipulation**: Claimed age inconsistent with appearance/documents

## Claim Fabrication Indicators

### Narrative Inconsistencies
- **Evolving story**: Significant details change between BOC and hearing
- **Rehearsed testimony**: Responses appear memorized, lack spontaneity
- **Generic persecution**: Claims mirror country conditions reports exactly
- **Implausible geography**: Described locations don't match actual geography

### Coordinated Claims
- **Multiple claimants with identical narratives**: Same story, same details
- **Shared consultant patterns**: Same representative filing similar claims
- **Regional clustering**: Surge of claims from specific region with similar stories
- **Template documents**: Supporting documents appear template-based

## Abuse of Process Indicators

### Delay Tactics
- **Multiple postponement requests**: Pattern of delay without legitimate reason
- **Late evidence disclosure**: Critical evidence produced only at hearing
- **Medical/psychological claims**: Unsubstantiated claims to avoid hearing
- **Representative changes**: Frequent changes to delay proceedings

### Claim Timing
- **Post-enforcement claim**: Claim made only after enforcement action
- **Multiple immigration attempts**: Prior failed applications before claiming
- **Status shopping**: Explored all other immigration options first
- **Re-availing after claim**: Travel to country of persecution during process

## Country-Specific Red Flags

### High-Volume Source Countries
- Claims from countries with established fraud patterns require enhanced scrutiny
- NOT determinative - legitimate claims exist from all countries

### Document Verification Issues
- Countries where document verification is difficult
- Countries with known document fraud networks
- Conflict zones where documents cannot be authenticated

## Investigation Triggers

### Automatic Referrals
- Multiple identity hits in FOSS/GCMS
- Previous removal order under different identity
- Security screening flags (A34/A35/A36/A37)
- Interpol or foreign law enforcement notices

### Discretionary Investigation
- Significant credibility concerns at interview
- Third-party tips or information
- Pattern analysis indicates coordinated fraud
- Documents fail authenticity verification

## Important Caveats

1. **Fraud indicators are NOT proof of fraud** - legitimate refugees may trigger some flags
2. **Trauma effects**: Inconsistencies may result from trauma, not fabrication
3. **Document unavailability**: Many genuine refugees flee without documents
4. **Cultural factors**: Communication styles vary across cultures
5. **Due process**: Claimants entitled to fair hearing regardless of flags

## IRCC/CBSA Protocol

When fraud suspected:
1. Document concerns in GCMS notes
2. Refer to enforcement for investigation if warranted
3. Maintain procedural fairness throughout
4. Allow claimant opportunity to respond to concerns
5. Decision must be based on evidence, not suspicion
