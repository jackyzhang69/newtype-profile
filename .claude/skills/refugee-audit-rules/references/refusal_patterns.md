# Refugee Refusal Patterns

## Overview

Common patterns in refugee claim refusals based on RPD/RAD decisions and Federal Court judicial reviews.

## Credibility-Based Refusals

### Pattern: Inconsistent Testimony

**Typical findings**:
- BOC narrative conflicts with oral testimony
- Key dates/events changed between submissions
- Details added or removed without explanation

**RPD reasoning**:
- "The claimant's testimony was internally inconsistent"
- "The panel finds the claimant's explanations for discrepancies implausible"
- "The documentary evidence contradicts the claimant's account"

**FC review standard**: Reasonableness - deference to RPD credibility findings

### Pattern: Implausibility

**Typical findings**:
- Claimed events defy common sense
- Behavior inconsistent with claimed fear
- Delay in claiming inconsistent with urgency

**RPD reasoning**:
- "It is implausible that the claimant would have [action] if genuinely fearful"
- "The panel finds it implausible that [event] occurred as described"

**FC review**: Panel must explain why implausible with reference to evidence

## Protection Ground Failures

### Pattern: Nexus Not Established

**Typical findings**:
- Harm is personal dispute, not Convention-related
- Criminal targeting, not persecution
- Family dispute framed as persecution

**RPD reasoning**:
- "The harm feared is not on a Convention ground"
- "This is a personal matter, not persecution"
- "The claimant has not established nexus to [ground]"

### Pattern: Persecution Threshold Not Met

**Typical findings**:
- Discrimination but not persecution
- Isolated incidents without pattern
- Hardship but not serious harm

**RPD reasoning**:
- "The treatment described, while unfortunate, does not amount to persecution"
- "These were isolated incidents that do not constitute a pattern of persecution"

## State Protection Refusals

### Pattern: Presumption Not Rebutted

**Typical findings**:
- Democratic state with functioning institutions
- Claimant did not seek protection
- Protection mechanisms available

**RPD reasoning**:
- "The claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection"
- "The claimant made no meaningful efforts to seek protection"
- "State protection, while imperfect, is operationally adequate"

### Pattern: Protection Adequate Despite Imperfection

**RPD standard**: State protection need not be perfect, only adequate

**Typical reasoning**:
- "No country can guarantee protection to all its citizens"
- "The existence of some failures does not negate overall adequacy"

## Internal Flight Alternative Refusals

### Pattern: IFA Exists

**Two-prong test**:
1. No serious possibility of persecution in IFA
2. Reasonable in all circumstances

**Typical findings**:
- Large city where claimant unknown
- Agent of persecution has limited reach
- Claimant has skills/family to support relocation

**RPD reasoning**:
- "There is a viable IFA in [city/region]"
- "The agent of persecution cannot locate the claimant in [IFA]"
- "It would be reasonable for the claimant to relocate"

## Exclusion Refusals (Article 1F)

### Pattern: 1F(a) - Crimes Against Humanity

**Elements found**:
- Armed conflict with documented atrocities
- Claimant's unit committed violations
- Knowledge and voluntary contribution established

**RPD reasoning**:
- "There are serious reasons for considering the claimant complicit"
- "The claimant had knowledge of and contributed to the organization's crimes"

### Pattern: 1F(b) - Serious Non-Political Crime

**Elements found**:
- Serious crime (objective gravity)
- Non-political (violence disproportionate)
- Outside Canada, prior to admission

**Note**: No balancing - once exclusion found, no protection regardless of risk

## Procedural Refusals

### Pattern: Abandonment

**Grounds**:
- Failed to appear at hearing
- Failed to provide required documents
- Failed to communicate with RPD

**Consequence**: Claim deemed abandoned, cannot re-file

### Pattern: Withdrawal

**Grounds**:
- Claimant requested withdrawal
- Deemed withdrawal due to non-compliance

**Consequence**: Cannot re-file claim

## Federal Court Success Patterns

### When JR Granted

Common grounds for successful judicial review:
- RPD failed to consider relevant evidence
- Credibility findings not supported by reasons
- Misapplication of legal test (IFA, state protection)
- Procedural fairness breach
- Failed to consider country conditions evidence

### Standard of Review

- **Reasonableness**: Most substantive issues
- **Correctness**: True questions of law, jurisdictional issues
