**STCA Exception Assessment Workflow**:
1. Does STCA bar apply? (Entry from U.S.)
2. If yes → Check each exception in order
3. If exception met → STCA bar removed, proceed to eligibility
4. If no exception → Ineligible under A101(1)(e)

## Protection Grounds Analysis

### Well-Founded Fear Test

**Objective component**: Reasonable possibility of persecution
**Subjective component**: Genuine fear held by claimant

**Standard**: More than mere possibility but less than probability

### Convention Grounds

| Ground | Definition | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Race | Ethnic/racial group | Ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples |
| Religion | Religious belief/practice | Religious minorities, converts, atheists |
| Nationality | Citizenship/cultural identity | Stateless persons, linguistic minorities |
| Political opinion | Actual or imputed | Activists, journalists, whistleblowers |
| Particular social group | Innate characteristic, shared history, perceived as group | Women, LGBTQ+, families of targeted individuals |

### Persecution Threshold

Persecution requires more than:
- Discrimination
- Harassment
- Prejudice
- General hardship

Must constitute:
- Serious harm to fundamental human rights
- Sustained or systemic mistreatment
- Cumulative acts reaching persecution level

## Exclusion Analysis (Article 1F)

### Article 1F(a) - Crimes Against Humanity

**Serious reasons for considering** committed:
- Crime against peace
- War crime
- Crime against humanity

**Complicity test**: Knowledge + voluntary significant contribution

### Article 1F(b) - Serious Non-Political Crime

**Elements**:
- Serious (gravity of offense)
- Non-political (violence disproportionate to political objective)
- Outside Canada
- Prior to admission as refugee

### Article 1F(c) - Acts Against UN Purposes

Reserved for persons in power positions:
- Government officials
- Senior military officers
- UN officials

**Note**: No balancing required once exclusion applies - person cannot receive protection regardless of risk upon return.

## State Protection Analysis

### Presumption of State Protection

Democratic states presumed able to protect citizens

**Rebuttal requires showing**:
- Claimant sought protection
- Protection was inadequate
- Or seeking protection would be futile

### Factors for Assessment

- Nature of persecution (state vs. non-state actor)
- Operational adequacy of police/military
- Willingness of authorities to act
- Past experience seeking protection
- Country conditions documentation

## Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)

### Two-Prong Test

**Prong 1 - Serious possibility of persecution in IFA?**
- Agent of persecution's reach
- State protection in IFA region

**Prong 2 - Reasonable in all circumstances?**
- Personal circumstances
- Physical safety
- Livelihood opportunities
- Conditions in IFA (not persecution-like)

### IFA Factors

- Claimant's profile and vulnerabilities
- Ability to travel safely
- Family separation considerations
- Economic circumstances
- Social/cultural factors

## Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA)

### PRRA Eligibility (A112)

**Who may apply**:
- Failed refugee claimants (after 12-month bar for most countries)
- Persons subject to removal order
- Persons named in removal certificate

**Ineligible for PRRA** (A112(2)):
- Within 12 months of RPD/RAD negative decision (except designated countries)
- Claimant from designated country of origin (DCO) - 36-month bar
- Previous PRRA rejection within 12 months
- Extradition cases

### PRRA vs. RPD Differences

| Factor | RPD Claim | PRRA |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Scope | A96 (Convention) + A97 (protection) | A97 only (unless never had RPD hearing) |
| Hearing | Oral hearing standard | Paper-based, hearing exceptional |
| New evidence | All evidence | Only new evidence since RPD |
| Standard | Fresh determination | New evidence + changed circumstances |

### PRRA New Evidence Test

Evidence admissible only if:
1. Arose after RPD/RAD rejection, OR
2. Was not reasonably available at RPD, OR
3. Could not reasonably have been expected to present at RPD

### PRRA Risk Analysis Framework

**For A97(1)(a) - Torture risk**:
- State involvement (direct or acquiescence)
- Personalized risk
- Substantial grounds for belief

**For A97(1)(b) - Risk to life / cruel treatment**:
- Personalized risk (not generalized)
- Not inherent to lawful sanctions
- Prospective assessment

### PRRA Decision Outcomes

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Positive | Protected person status under A95(1)(c) |
| Negative | Removal proceeds |
| Deferred | Stay of removal pending reconsideration |

### PRRA Timing Considerations

- Application deadline: 15 days from notice
- Decision typically before removal
- Judicial review available (leave required)

## Cessation and Vacation (A108-109)

### Cessation Grounds (A108)

| Ground | Section | Trigger |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Re-availed of nationality | A108(1)(a) | Renewed passport, voted in elections |
| Reacquired nationality | A108(1)(b) | Became citizen again |
| Acquired new nationality | A108(1)(c) | Citizenship in third country |
| Re-established in home country | A108(1)(d) | Returned to live permanently |
| Changed circumstances | A108(1)(e) | Objective change in country conditions |

**Cessation Analysis for Audit**:
- Any return trips to country of persecution?
- Contact with country's consulate/embassy?
- Renewed identity documents from country?
- Family members returned?

### Vacation (A109)

**Grounds for vacation**:
- Refugee status obtained by fraud
- Misrepresentation of material facts
- Withholding material facts

**Effect**: Loss of protected person status, removal proceedings

### Cessation/Vacation Risk in Audit

| Indicator | Risk Level | Score Impact |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Returned to COI once (emergency) | MEDIUM | -10 |
| Returned to COI multiple times | HIGH | -20 |
| Renewed COI passport | HIGH | -15 |
| Contact with COI authorities | MEDIUM | -10 |
| Re-established in COI | CRITICAL | Poison Pill |
| Misrepresentation discovered | CRITICAL | Poison Pill |
