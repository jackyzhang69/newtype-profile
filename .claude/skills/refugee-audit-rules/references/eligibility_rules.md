## Protection Grounds Analysis

### Well-Founded Fear Test

**Objective component**: Reasonable possibility of persecution
**Subjective component**: Genuine fear held by claimant

**Standard**: More than mere possibility but less than probability

### Convention Grounds

| Ground | Definition | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Race | Ethnic/racial group | Ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples |
| Religion | Religious belief/practice | Religious minorities, converts, atheists |
| Nationality | Citizenship/cultural identity | Stateless persons, linguistic minorities |
| Political opinion | Actual or imputed | Activists, journalists, whistleblowers |
| Particular social group | Innate characteristic, shared history, perceived as group | Women, LGBTQ+, families of targeted individuals |

### Persecution Threshold

Persecution requires more than:
- Discrimination
- Harassment
- Prejudice
- General hardship

Must constitute:
- Serious harm to fundamental human rights
- Sustained or systemic mistreatment
- Cumulative acts reaching persecution level

## Exclusion Analysis (Article 1F)

### Article 1F(a) - Crimes Against Humanity

**Serious reasons for considering** committed:
- Crime against peace
- War crime
- Crime against humanity

**Complicity test**: Knowledge + voluntary significant contribution

### Article 1F(b) - Serious Non-Political Crime

**Elements**:
- Serious (gravity of offense)
- Non-political (violence disproportionate to political objective)
- Outside Canada
- Prior to admission as refugee

### Article 1F(c) - Acts Against UN Purposes

Reserved for persons in power positions:
- Government officials
- Senior military officers
- UN officials

**Note**: No balancing required once exclusion applies - person cannot receive protection regardless of risk upon return.

## State Protection Analysis

### Presumption of State Protection

Democratic states presumed able to protect citizens

**Rebuttal requires showing**:
- Claimant sought protection
- Protection was inadequate
- Or seeking protection would be futile

### Factors for Assessment

- Nature of persecution (state vs. non-state actor)
- Operational adequacy of police/military
- Willingness of authorities to act
- Past experience seeking protection
- Country conditions documentation

## Internal Flight Alternative (IFA)

### Two-Prong Test

**Prong 1 - Serious possibility of persecution in IFA?**
- Agent of persecution's reach
- State protection in IFA region

**Prong 2 - Reasonable in all circumstances?**
- Personal circumstances
- Physical safety
- Livelihood opportunities
- Conditions in IFA (not persecution-like)

### IFA Factors

- Claimant's profile and vulnerabilities
- Ability to travel safely
- Family separation considerations
- Economic circumstances
- Social/cultural factors
