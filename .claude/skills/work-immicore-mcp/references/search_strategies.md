## Search Optimization Tips

### For Comprehensive Coverage
1. **Caselaw**: Start broad, then narrow to specific issues
2. **Operation Manual**: Use multiple query angles for same topic
3. **Help Centre**: Cross-reference applicant guidance with policy
4. **NOC**: Always verify job title classification
5. **Tools**: Check for official IRCC calculators

### For Efficiency
1. Prioritize FC cases (exclude lower courts)
2. Focus on recent cases (2020-2025) unless precedent essential
3. Check manual for policy before researching case law
4. Use issue-specific queries rather than general searches
5. Combine searches to find intersection of issues

### For Reliability
1. Verify case citations are complete and accurate
2. Check case status (not overruled, remains good law)
3. Cross-reference operation manual with case reasoning
4. Ensure help centre guidance aligns with policy
5. Document all sources in audit report

## Common Search Pitfalls

### Do Not
- Rely solely on help centre (not authoritative)
- Use IAD/IRB decisions (use FC/FCA only)
- Assume old case law still applies without checking
- Mix different court jurisdictions
- Generalize from single case

### Do Instead
- Combine caselaw + operation manual + help centre
- Focus on Federal Court precedents
- Verify case law currency
- Distinguish between FC and other courts
- Look for consistent patterns across multiple cases

## Integration with Audit Phases

### Detective Phase
- Search for landmark cases on key issues
- Build legal framework from case law
- Identify policy baseline from operation manual

### Strategist Phase
- Deep-dive search on specific risks identified
- Find cases supporting defense strategies
- Identify evidence needed per case law

### Gatekeeper Phase
- Verify all cited cases are still good law
- Confirm policy interpretation is current
- Cross-check reasoning against operation manual

### Verifier Phase
- Validate all case citations are accurate
- Check cases are FC/FCA (not other courts)
- Confirm court decisions match stated outcome
