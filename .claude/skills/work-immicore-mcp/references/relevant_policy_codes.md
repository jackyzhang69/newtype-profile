## Policy Interpretation Framework

### Hierarchy of Authority
1. **Legislation** (IRPA, Immigration Regulation)
2. **Court Decisions** (Federal Court binding, appeals courts most authoritative)
3. **Operation Manual** (IRCC guidance, persuasive but not binding)
4. **Help Centre** (Applicant-facing guidance, lowest authority)

### Application in Audit
- Identify applicable legislation
- Cite controlling case law
- Reference operation manual for context
- Use help centre to show applicant perspective

## Common Policy Issues
