# 双重意图措辞指南 (Dual Intent Phrasing Guide)

> **最后更新**: 2026-01-26
> 
> **核心原则**: 双重意图 (Dual Intent) 在加拿大移民法下是**被允许的**（IRPA 22(2)），但**表述方式**极其重要。
> 错误的措辞可能导致签证官质疑申请人的真实学习意图。

---

## 一、法律基础

### 1.1 IRPA 22(2) 条款

> **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Section 22(2):**
> "An intention by a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay."

**翻译**: 外国人有成为永久居民的意图，并不妨碍他们成为临时居民，只要签证官确信他们会在授权停留期限结束时离开加拿大。

### 1.2 关键判例

| 案例 | 年份 | 关键原则 |
|------|------|----------|
| **Luk v Canada** | 2024 FC 623 | 表述方式比意图本身更重要 |
| Patel v Canada | 2020 FC 77 | 境内申请人有权获得公平评估 |
| Khan v Canada | 2019 FC 1243 | 必须展示假设性离境计划 |

---

## 二、核心原则

| ✅ 承认 PGWP 的存在 | "I am aware of the PGWP opportunity..." |
| ✅ 展示长期职业规划 | "My ultimate career goal is to..." |
| ✅ 表达回国发展意愿 | "I plan to return to contribute to..." |

### 2.2 应该避免的内容

| 避免 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| ❌ 明确说"不打算回国" | "I have no intention of returning..." |
| ❌ 将学签作为移民跳板 | "This is my pathway to immigration..." |
| ❌ 过度强调 PGWP/PR | "My main goal is to get PGWP and PR..." |

## 三、好/坏措辞对比

### 3.1 关于毕业后计划

#### ❌ 坏措辞 (Bad Phrasing)

```
"After graduation, I plan to stay in Canada permanently. I will apply for 
PGWP and then PR. Canada is where I want to build my future, and I have 
no intention of returning to my home country."
```

**问题**:
- 明确表示不回国
- 过度强调移民意图
- 没有假设性离境计划

#### ✅ 好措辞 (Good Phrasing)

```
"After completing my studies, I will evaluate my career options based on 
the opportunities available at that time. I am aware that Canada offers 
post-graduation work opportunities, and I may explore gaining some 
international work experience if circumstances permit. However, my 
education in Canada will be valuable regardless of where my career takes 
me. The skills and knowledge I gain will be highly relevant to the growing 
[行业] sector in my home country, where I have strong family ties and 
professional networks that I intend to maintain."
```

**优点**:
- 保持选择开放
- 承认 PGWP 但不过度强调
- 展示回国的可能性和价值
- 强调与原籍国的联系

---

### 3.2 关于选择加拿大的原因

#### ❌ 坏措辞

```
"I chose Canada because it is easier to immigrate here after studying. 
The PGWP and Express Entry programs make it possible to become a 
permanent resident within a few years."
```

**问题**:
- 将学习作为移民工具
- 暴露真实移民意图
- 缺乏学术理由

#### ✅ 好措辞

```
"I chose Canada for its world-renowned education system and the specific 
strengths of [学校名称] in [专业领域]. The program's curriculum aligns 
perfectly with my career goals in [职业方向]. Additionally, Canada's 
multicultural environment will provide valuable exposure to global 
perspectives, which will be beneficial for my future career in the 
increasingly international [行业] industry."
```

**优点**:
- 强调学术和教育原因
- 具体到学校和专业
- 与职业发展挂钩
- 避免提及移民

---

### 3.3 关于 PGWP 的提及

#### ❌ 坏措辞

```
"The PGWP is the main reason I chose this program. It allows me to work 
for 3 years and gain enough points for Express Entry."
```

#### ⚠️ 勉强可接受 (但不推荐)

```
"I am aware that graduates may be eligible for work permits, which could 
provide an opportunity to gain international work experience."
```

#### ✅ 好措辞

```
"While my primary focus is on completing my studies and achieving academic 
excellence, I understand that Canadian education provides graduates with 
various opportunities. Should circumstances permit, gaining some practical 
experience in Canada's advanced [行业] sector could enhance my skills 
before I apply them in my home country's growing market."
```

**技巧**:
- 将 PGWP 作为"可能的附带好处"而非"主要目标"
- 强调技能提升而非移民通道
- 始终与回国可能性挂钩

---

### 3.4 关于回国计划

#### ❌ 坏措辞

```
"I honestly don't know if I will return. It depends on whether I can get 
PR status."
```

#### ✅ 好措辞

the rapidly developing [行业] sector. My family has a [生意/企业] in 
[城市], and my parents are looking forward to my return to help expand 
the business with my newly acquired skills and international perspective. 
The [行业] industry in [国家] is experiencing significant growth, with 
companies actively seeking professionals with international education 
backgrounds."
```

**要素**:
- 具体的回国计划
- 家庭联系
- 行业机会
- 个人价值增值
