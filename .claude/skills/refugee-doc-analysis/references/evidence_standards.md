# Refugee Evidence Standards

## Legal Framework

### Standard of Proof

**Balance of probabilities**: More likely than not (>50%)

However, due to difficulties faced by refugee claimants:
- Benefit of the doubt applies when evidence is generally credible
- Not all claims require documentary proof
- Claimant's testimony alone can be sufficient if credible

### UNHCR Handbook Guidance

> "The requirement of evidence should thus not be too strictly applied in view of the difficulty of proof inherent in the special situation in which an applicant for refugee status finds himself."

## Evidence Requirements by Element

### Identity

**Must establish on balance of probabilities**

Acceptable evidence:
- Valid passport (strongest)
- National ID card
- Birth certificate
- Baptismal records
- School records
- Any government-issued document

If no documents:
- Credible testimony about identity
- Witness statements from family/community
- Circumstantial evidence (language, knowledge)

### Well-Founded Fear

**Objective component**: Reasonable possibility of persecution
**Subjective component**: Genuine fear held by claimant

Evidence types:
- Past persecution (strong indicator of future risk)
- Documentary evidence of persecution
- Country conditions showing pattern
- Expert evidence on risk

### Nexus to Convention Ground

**Must show persecution is "for reasons of" Convention ground**

Evidence needed:
- Evidence of the protected characteristic (race, religion, etc.)
- Evidence persecution is motivated by that characteristic
- Can be actual characteristic OR imputed by persecutor

### State Protection Inadequacy

**Must rebut presumption of state protection**

Evidence types:
- Documentation of efforts to seek protection
- Evidence protection was refused/inadequate
- Country conditions showing systemic failure
- Expert evidence on state's ability to protect

### No Internal Flight Alternative

**Must show IFA not viable**

Evidence for each prong:
1. **Safety**: Evidence agent can locate claimant in IFA
2. **Reasonableness**: Evidence IFA would be unduly harsh

## Credibility Assessment Factors

### Positive Indicators

- Consistent testimony over time
- Spontaneous, detailed recollection
- Documentary corroboration
- Plausible narrative
- Appropriate demeanor
- Timely claim

### Concerning Indicators

- Significant inconsistencies
- Vague or evasive responses
- Changing story
- Implausible elements
- Documents contradict testimony
- Long delay in claiming

### Credibility Considerations

**Trauma effects**:
- Memory fragmentation
- Inconsistent recall
- Difficulty discussing traumatic events
- Flat or inappropriate affect

**Cultural factors**:
- Communication style differences
- Reluctance to disclose certain information
- Different concepts of time/dates

## Evidence Weight Factors

### Document Weight Considerations

| Factor | Higher Weight | Lower Weight |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Source | Official, authenticated | Self-created, unverified |
| Consistency | Consistent with other evidence | Conflicts with record |
| Specificity | Specific to claimant | Generic information |
| Timeliness | Contemporaneous with events | Created for claim |
| Format | Original document | Copy, unclear |

### Testimony Weight Considerations

| Factor | Higher Weight | Lower Weight |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Detail | Specific, detailed | Vague, general |
| Consistency | Consistent throughout | Changing account |
| Spontaneity | Natural responses | Rehearsed answers |
| Explanation | Explains discrepancies | Cannot explain issues |
| Corroboration | Supported by documents | No support |

## Country Conditions Evidence

### Authoritative Sources

1. **UNHCR** - Most authoritative for refugee matters
2. **Human Rights Watch** - Detailed country research
3. **Amnesty International** - Human rights monitoring
4. **US State Department** - Country reports
5. **UK Home Office** - Country policy guidance
6. **Canadian IRB** - National Documentation Packages

### Using Country Conditions

- Must link general conditions to personal risk
- General conditions alone insufficient
- Show claimant falls within persecuted group
- Demonstrate personal nexus to conditions

## Corroboration Requirements

### When Required

- Central elements of claim
- Elements that can reasonably be documented
- Assertions that contradict other evidence

### When Not Required

- Cannot reasonably obtain evidence
- Evidence was destroyed by circumstances
- Testimony is otherwise credible
- Type of claim where documentation rare

## Missing Evidence Considerations

### Acceptable Explanations

- Fled in haste, couldn't bring documents
- Documents destroyed in conflict
- Government confiscated documents
- Country doesn't issue certain documents
- Document not issued for persecuted groups

### Concerning Situations

- Documents available but not provided
- Multiple versions of documents
- Documents obtained specifically for claim
- Explanation for absence implausible
