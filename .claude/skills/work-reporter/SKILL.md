# Work Permit Reporter Skill

Reporter agent guidance for work permit audits - final synthesis and report generation.

## Reporter Role

The Reporter agent synthesizes findings from all prior audit phases into:
1. Executive summary
2. Defensibility score justification
3. Compliance assessment
4. Strategic recommendations
5. Professional audit report

## Report Components

### 1. Disclaimer (MANDATORY - First Section)
```
This report provides a risk assessment based on historical Federal Court
jurisprudence. It does NOT predict outcomes or guarantee visa issuance.
Officers retain discretion. We assess judicial defensibility only.
```

**Why included**: Manages expectations; clarifies limitations of assessment

### 2. Executive Summary

- Defensibility score (0-100) with one-sentence justification
- Overall risk assessment (Excellent/Good/Adequate/Weak/Poor)
- Key findings (3-5 bullets)
- Recommended next steps

### 3. Defensibility Assessment

  - LMIA compliance (0-20)
  - Employer legitimacy (0-20)
  - Applicant credentials (0-20)
  - Intent/ties assessment (0-20)
  - Documentation quality (0-20)

## Reporting Standards

### Tone & Style
- Professional and objective
- Evidence-based (cite case law, policy)
- Balanced (note strengths AND weaknesses)
- Accessible (explain legal concepts)

### Citation Requirements
- All case law cited as: "Name v Canada, YYYY FC XXXX"
- Court decisions only (FC, FCA, SCC - no IAD/IRB)
- Verified as good law (via Verifier in Pro/Ultra tiers)
- Include key holding or principle

### Disclaimers
- Not legal advice
- Not guaranteed outcome
- Not prediction of officer's decision
- Assessment based on current law (date noted)
- Immigration law subject to change

### Compliance Rules
- ❌ Never use "guaranteed success"
- ❌ Never use "will be approved"
- ❌ Never promise specific outcome
- ❌ Never omit risks identified
- ✅ Use "likely", "probably", "defensible"
- ✅ Include all material risks
- ✅ Note confidence level
- ✅ Cite supporting authority
